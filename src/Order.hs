-- the completeness of lambda-superposition depends on an order that is stable under substitutions,
-- however the derived Kbo from "superposition with lambdas" is not stable for eta-long terms (which is what we have sometimes).
-- (similar issues arise when finding green subterms later)
-- (the incompleteness resulting from ignoring this swould be minor [source: private communication with Blanchette],
-- because most terms that come up in practice are identical in their η-long and η-short forms).
-- there are two options for obtaining a reflexive closure of the nonground, strict term order ⪰_λ:
-- 1. s ≻_λ t ⟺ O(s) ≻_fo O(t), and use αβη-convertibility to obtain the reflexive closure
-- 2. equip ≻_fo with syntactic equality (deriving instance Eq FO(F)Val) to obtain ⪰_fo, then define: s ⪰_λ t ⟺ O(s) ⪰_fo O(t)
-- both options only work with η-normal values (long or short, they just have to both be either expanded or reduced).
-- the whole point is that η-equivalent higher-order terms should compare as equal under ⪰_λ.
-- (a third option would be to implement η-long NbE + an unpublished order from Blanchette, which does not exhibit the problem
-- of being unstable under η-long substitutions, and would actually make the calculus complete [source: private
-- communication with Bentkamp]
